1.2 RC8

	PHP

			DS name in RRDTool file were stored in code. Detect DS names from position in RRD file.
			hardcoded call to rrdtool in rrd.php fixed.
			histo.php called index.php instead of w4rrd.php since 1.2RC6 release
			
			
		Enhancement
			Graph are displayed in bits rather than in bytes
			add checks for debugging in graph generation
			add capability to display your own content in overlib window like with
						LINKOVERLIBGRAPH http://www.google.fr/intl/fr_fr/images/logo.gif
					or
						LINKOVERLIBGRAPH currentvalues.php (where currentvalues.php could be replaced by your own php script)
						You have to set up php.ini file with allow_url_fopen = On. For security reason this is often disabled. 
						See http://fr.php.net/manual/en/ref.filesystem.php#ini.allow-url-fopen for details.


			disable label display if no label is set in configuration file
			allow to choose display node with a circle instead of usual box (LABELTYPE round)
			allow to disable display of number on internodes rounds (INTERNODENUMDISP directive)
			allow to disable display of color round for middle internode (INTERNODEDISPLAYMID directive)
			allow to use different source files for input and output values of a link (TARGETIN and TARGETOUT directives)
			new legend display available (LEGENDSTYLE line)
			new type of link arrows available (ARROW halfarrow)


1.2 RC7

	PHP

		BUGS fixed
			height and width map display that created a blank screen with Internet Explorer
			config variable was not take into account by index.php. It was only with w4rrd.php.

			Thank you to Dan Lowry for his contribution to fix theses bugs

1.2 RC6 

	PHP
		BUGS fixed
			sometimes last value of RRDTool 1.2 database was not found

		NEW FEATURES
			add link bandwidth graph popup over map (LINKOVERLIBGRAPH,LINKINFOURL,HTMLFILE directives)
				(thank you to Bertrand Schvallinger and others that send me some ideas or code). 
				WARNING : you need to copy overlib_mini.js to your webserver docroot. This file is used by index.php.
				
			add capability of choosing configuration filename with "config" variable (example : http://myserver/weathermap/index.php?config=internet.conf )
				(thank you to hoffswell for his simple but useful modification)
			add node check (IP and CHECK directives)
				You are able to test node presence in network (ping or tcp port check available). 
				I suggest to use TCP check rather than ping because it is really faster if node is unreachable.
			add new legend display available (use LEGENDSTYLE directive to choose between "original" or "line" style)
			add LEGENDPOS directives to define LEGEND position in map (same as KEYPOS that is still available)
			add REFRESH directive to specify period between refresh of display (default is 60 seconds)
