To install the router component of Network Manager, follow these steps
Download and install OPENWRT on your router if you haven't already. Instructions can be found on the OPENWRT
website, located at http://openwrt.org/. Please note, the router scripts currently only support routers based on
the Atheros WIFI chipset, using ATH9K software. It requires the 'iw' command to obtain state information.
Follow the instructions in basic configuration of OPENWRT to enable WIFI on your router and enable SSH login.
Go to http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin and enable SSH secure log in and then proceed to the basic
configuration page.
Follow the instructions at http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.storage to enable USB storage on your router.
You need a USB Disk / thumb drive to store the router scripts.
Install the following modules with the opkg install command: hostapd, wpa-supplicant, ntp-client, php5,
php5-cgi
These instructions assume you mount your USB disk at /mnt/usbdisk. You will need to replace any reference to this
as applicable to your setup.
You will need to follow the instructions to enable auto mount on boot listed on the USB storage page.
You will be setting storing files on the USB disk that other components require to start, so the disk needs to
be available when the router is turned on.
To edit files you need to use the editor vi. To edit text in a file, press i. When you are done press the
escape key. Then press : then w then q and then press enter to save and quit.
Run the following commands to set up files needed, pressing enter after each one.
cd /mnt/usbdisk
mkdir www
cd www
mkdir dns
touch dns/log
mkdir uploads
mkdir xml
chmod a+w xml
ls
The last command will list all the files and folders you have in your www folder.
You should have cgi-bin, dns, luci-static, index.html, upload.php, uploads and xml
If any of cgi-bin, dns, uploads or xml are missing run mkdir name, but replace name with the name of the missing 
folder.
Then run vi /etc/dnsmasq.conf.
Add the following lines at the bottom of the file replacing /mnt/usbdisk with the location of your
usb disk, save and quit:
log-queries
log-facility=/mnt/usbdisk/www/dns/log
The router needs to accept data over the Internet, open /etc/config/firewall and add the following lines, save 
and quit:
config 'rule'
option 'src' 'wan'
option 'proto' 'tcp'
option 'dest_port' '1080'
option 'target' 'ACCEPT'
config 'rule'
option 'src' 'wan'
option 'proto' 'tcp'
option 'dest_port' '1085'
option 'target' 'ACCEPT'
Now you have permitted access, you need to configure the router to request a password for every configuration
page requested. To do so, you should run vi /etc/httpd.conf
Add the following line, save and quit
/:root:$p$root
It must be in exactly that format. Your username will be root, and your password will be the one you entered
in the passwd command shown on the first login page linked above
Now you need to edit the webserver configuration.
vi /etc/config/uhttpd
edit the line list listen_http so that the port is changed to 1080
edit the line option home so that the 3rd value is the location of the www folder on your usb disk
for example it could be
option home /mnt/usbdisk/www
There should not be a / on the end
Add the following 2 lines to the file (line containing php may already be present, just remove the # if it is)
list interpreter ".php=/usr/bin/php-cgi"                
list interpreter ".sh=/bin/sh"
Then save and close the file
Then you need to configure the PHP script interpreter
vi /etc/php.ini
edit the line with short_open_tag so that it has "= On" without quotes
edit the line cgi.force_redirect  so that it has "= 0" without quotes
edit the line doc_root so that it has = "/mnt/usbdisk/www" (including quotes must be same as option home in
/etc/config/uhttpd)
save and quit
enter the following command and press enter
/etc/init.d/uhttpd enable
That command starts the webserver at boot
then run /etc/init.d/uhttpd start
If configured correctly, you should see a success response
try and navigate to http://192.168.1.1:1085 in a webbrowser
You should see a popup asking for a username and password
enter root and the password set in the passwd command
You should then see the luci login screen, and be able to login. This is described in the basic configuration
pages.
If everything works, next do
cd /mnt/usb-disk/www/cgi-bin
wget http://networkmanagerapp.com/support_files/devices.sh
wget http://networkmanagerapp.com/support_files/networkSettings.sh
wget http://networkmanagerapp.com/support_files/rrd.sh
wget http://networkmanagerapp.com/support_files/upload.php
wget http://networkmanagerapp.com/support_files/wifi.sh
For each of those files, you need to do chmod a+x filename
eg chmod a+x devices.sh
Assuming you have devices connected to your router via WIFI, navigate to 
http://192.168.1.1:1080/cgi-bin/devices.sh
You should get a response of Success.
You can then navigate to http://192.168.1.1:1080/xml/devices.xml and you should see details about connected 
devices
