Weathermap4RRD (php version)

Weathermap4RRD is a set of scripts that generates picture of network links utilization. Data used to create graph are acquired from RRDTool databases and are displayed as two ways colored arrows on a map representing the logical topology of the network. This program is based on original Network Weathermap script written by Panagiotis Christias (see below for Network Weathermap README file content).

Weathermap4RRD exists as php or perl scripts.
